**Problem:** {problem}

**Solution Approach:**
This appears to be an algebraic equation. Let me guide you through the general solution process:

**For Linear Equations (like ax + b = c):**
1. **Identify the equation:** Look for the variable (usually x) and constants
2. **Isolate the variable term:** Move constants to the other side
3. **Solve for the variable:** Divide by the coefficient
4. **Check your answer:** Substitute back into the original equation

**Example Process:**
If you have 2x + 5 = 15:
• Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10
• Divide both sides by 2: x = 5
• Check: 2(5) + 5 = 15 ✓

**For your specific problem:**
Please ensure the equation is clearly written with an equals sign (=) and specify which variable to solve for.

**Common Formats:**
• 2x + 5 = 15 (solve for x)
• 3y - 7 = 20 (solve for y)
• ax + b = c (solve for x)
